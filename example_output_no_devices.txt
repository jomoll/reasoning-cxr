Reasoning:
  - Step 1:
    Description: Cardiac Size and Contours
    Action:
      - I assess cardiothoracic ratio; the heart appears enlarged.
      - Cardiac contours are clear and well-defined.
    Result: The heart size is enlarged.
  - Step 2:
    Description: Pulmonary Vascular Congestion
    Action:
      - I assess vascular markings for redistribution.
      - I note increased vascular markings in the upper lung zones.
      - I note Kerley B lines and peribronchial cuffing.
      - There is peribronchial cuffing.
      - There is a sign of pulmonary edema.
    Result: Findings indicate moderate pulmonary vascular congestion. 
  - Step 3:
    Description: Pleural Effusion
    Action:
      - I examine costophrenic angles bilaterally.
      - Right angle is blunted with opacity; moderate effusion.
      - Left angle is obliterated with larger opacity; severe effusion.
    Result: Moderate right and severe left pleural effusions.
  - Step 4:
    Description: Atelectasis
    Action:
      - I inspect lung parenchyma for collapse.
      - Right lung is fully expanded; no atelectasis.
      - Left lung shows opacity and volume loss consistent with compression from effusion.
    Result: Left compression atelectasis due to pleural effusion; no right atelectasis.
  - Step 5:
    Description: Pulmonary Infiltrates
    Action:
      - I search for alveolar or interstitial opacities.
      - Right lower lung zone demonstrates patchy opacity consistent with pneumonia.
      - Left lung shows no infiltrative abnormalities.
    Result: Right lower lobe pneumonic infiltrates; left lung clear.
  - Step 6:
    Description: Impression
    Action:
      - I synthesize all findings into a concise summary
      - Diagnostic-quality image.
      - Left subclavian central line appropriately placed.
      - Right chest tube in situ.
      - Cardiomegaly with signs of intermediate pulmonary vascular congestion.
      - No endotracheal or nasogastric tubes.
      - Moderate right and severe left pleural effusions causing left compression atelectasis.
      - Right lower lobe pneumonic infiltrates.
      - No pneumothorax or other devices present.
    Result: Impression consistent with congestive heart failure exacerbation and bilateral pleural effusions, worse on the left, with superimposed right lower lobe pneumonia.
